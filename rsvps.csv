"Alex","Chorey","","False","0","alex_chorey","Congratulations guys!  I'm so excited for the two of you, but sad to say that I won't be able to make it in August.  Anna and I got engaged a few weeks ago, and we're scrambling to put together plans for a small wedding of our own for family in early September.  I think time is just going to be a little tight.  

I've been looking forward to meeting Butsina for a long time, and seeing Chiedo get married is something I'll be sad to miss.  I guess I'll just have to wait until you guys come visit in Seattle next time.  Wishing you all the best!
